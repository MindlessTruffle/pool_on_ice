Welcome to Pool on Ice, a Python project featuring a tabletop pool game with customizable physics and a charming winter theme. This project has been created exclusively using the Pygame and Pymunk libraries.

Project Overview:

I undertook this project as a personal challenge, aiming to complete it as quickly as possible. As a result, there are current inefficiencies in the animation system and audio balancing that I acknowledge can be improved.

Get Involved:

If you're interested in contributing to this project or have ideas to enhance the game, please feel free to dive in. Your expertise and suggestions are highly welcomed as we seek to refine and optimize various aspects of the game. 

Acknowledgments:

I'd like to express my gratitude to the documentation, demos, and community projects that provided valuable resources for building the logic and systems of this game.
